# Python Lessons (12-Week Homework Set)

How to run any lesson:
1. Open a terminal (Command Prompt or PowerShell on Windows).
2. Navigate to this folder.
3. Run: `python lesson1.py` (replace with the lesson you want).

Notes for screen reader users:
- Each file has clear prompts and prints results line-by-line.
- No special libraries needed; Python 3.9+ recommended.
- Files that write output create `.txt` files in the same folder.
